This is a brief summary of the project I worked on today in my alx task

I was taught on function pointers in C
These below are the files and the the brief description of the files my codes are present in.
i.) function_pointers.h: Header file containing all my function prototypes
ii.) 0-print_name.c:Source File for a function that prints a name.
iii.) 1-array_iterator.c:Source File for a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
iv.) 2-int_index.c: Source file for a function that searches for an integer.
v.) 3-calc.h: Header file for 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, and 3-get_op_func.c.
vi.) 3-main.c: Source file that performs simple operations passed in as parameters.
vii.) 3-op_functions: Source file with five functions
	op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);	op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);
	op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);
	op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);
	op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);
ix.) 3-get_op_func.c: Source file that contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the use
x.) 100-main_opcodes.c: a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
